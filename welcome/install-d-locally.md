# Install D locally

The D language reference compiler is called DMD (Digital Mars D).
Also available are [LDC](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc)
(a [LLVM](http://llvm.org)-based D compiler).
and [GDC](https://gdcproject.org) (a [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)-based D
compiler).
See [the Compilers wiki page](https://wiki.dlang.org/Compilers) for
more detailed information, but if you're new to D and aren't sure
which to install, install DMD.

## Download and Install

The [D downloads page](https://dlang.org/download.html) provides an
overview of the various D implementations, and contains links to
pre-built OS-specific DMD packages ready to download and install.

As an alternative to the OS-specific packages, there's also an
[install script](https://dlang.org/install.html)
for use with any Posix-like System (Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS)
that can install the various implementations (including multiple versions of them)
locally without requiring any administration rights.
See the [install script documentation](https://dlang.org/install.html) for details.

## Configure your editor

The beauty about D is that you don't need a fancy IDE as boilerplate code is very rare.
However, using D is nicer when you are in the comfortable zone of your favorite editor.
There are D plugins for at least the following editors:

- [Atom](https://github.com/Pure-D/atomize-d)
- [Eclipse](http://ddt-ide.github.io)
- [Emacs](https://github.com/Emacs-D-Mode-Maintainers/Emacs-D-Mode)
- [IntelliJ](https://github.com/intellij-dlanguage/intellij-dlanguage)
- [Sublime Text](https://github.com/yazd/DKit)
- [Vim](https://wiki.dlang.org/D_in_Vim)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/webfreak.code-d)
- [__Visual Studio__](http://rainers.github.io/visuald/visuald/StartPage.html)

You may also want to try an IDE dedicated to D:

- [Coedit](https://github.com/BBasile/Coedit)
- [Dlang IDE](https://github.com/buggins/dlangide)

The D wiki contains a more detailed overview of available [editors](https://wiki.dlang.org/Editors) and [IDEs](https://wiki.dlang.org/IDEs).
